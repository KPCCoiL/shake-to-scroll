#+title: Shake to Scroll

* What's this?
A fake terms of use window that you need to shake it to scroll down.
Made for [[https://reddit.com/r/badUIbattles]].

* Installation
#+begin_src bash
  go get github.com/KPCCoiL/shake-to-scroll
#+end_src

* Caveat
Parameters (e.g. how fast you need to shake the window) are tuned for my MacBook. It may not be annoying enough on your machine or platform.
